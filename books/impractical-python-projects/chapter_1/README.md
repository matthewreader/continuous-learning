# Chapter 1

The chapter focuses on a simple random name generator to demonstrate PEP 8  style guide for Python code and PEP 257 docstring conventions for Python code.  Tools such as Pylint are introduced as a way of checking code conformity to Python style guides.  The file `pseudonyms_main_fixed.py` is given as an example random name generator with style issues corrected and can be found at the [Impractical Python Projects]( https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects ) website.



* `pseudonyms_main_fixed.py` - Original random name generator given that conforms to PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines.
* `the_middle.py` - Updated random name generator that adds a middle name one third of the time.  Names are Christmas elf themed.
